We've all heard of HP, it's one of the most popular brands of office tech - especially in the computer world - that can deliver what you need when you need it. I own a Windows 10 HP PC myself - in fact, its the very one I'm using to write this review. But enough about the company brand itself, let's talk about a certain product of theirs and dive into its features, quality, and general reception amongst buyers. Today, we're reviewing the [***2019 HP Premium HD Laptop***](https://www.amazon.com/HP-15-6-inch-Dual-Core-MaxxAudio-Bluetooth/dp/B07QKWTZ4B/ref=sr_1_5&tag-reviewhuntr-20). Sold online at the very popular Amazon retail shopping website.

Released on April 10, 2019, this personal laptop has managed to rank #60 in amazon's "Computers and Accessories" category; as well as scoring #6 in Traditional Laptop Computers. It's to say this tech tool is not under the radar - and one you won't have trouble finding in Amazon's search results. But, it is on the cheaper side of the competition. Selling for a measly $349.00, which does include free shipping. With that in mind, this laptop can be interpreted best as a "budget" product, with a "Get what you pay for" type of situation. So remember to keep that in mind before adding this to your laptop wishlist.

As for specs, it isn't indecent. The [***2019 HP HD***](https://www.amazon.com/HP-15-6-inch-Dual-Core-MaxxAudio-Bluetooth/dp/B07QKWTZ4B/ref=sr_1_5&tag-reviewhuntr-20) is lightweight, making it a better option for those who don't like carrying around a heavy object in their backpack or briefcase. However, it is on the larger side in terms of screen-size - which is a solid 15.6 inches. Though, this does mean you won't have to worry about a small-screen; especially if you hate squinting. Other notable specs would be its OS, which is running 64-bit Windows 10, the fact it supports both WIFI and Bluetooth connectivity, and that it a has useful 8GB of ram. Which on paper, makes it sound like a pretty good buy if you need a cheap laptop for school or work purposes. But before reading any further, let's take a rain-check on that idea.

Rated 3.7 out of 5 stars, and sitting at 116 total reviews. The consumer opinion of this device seems to be relatively positive, with a tad bit of negativity thrown in the mix. But, don't let that fool you into making an impulsive decision. After reading through a multitude of more recent reviews, I seem to get the idea that this product is not all that it's "cracked" up to be. Several reviewers have claimed that their device has arrived defective or not-working, such as this review by Katherine L. Others have included a sentiment of dissatisfaction with their experience, many claiming that their copy of the laptop had slow processing speeds, and consistent periods of delays and freezes; both of which can severely bother someone if their on a schedule. This review coincides with the report of delay, noting that the product has trouble with opening files and apps; something I would consider a bit of a turn-off when said product claims to have an 8 gig RAM. Amazon user ifrah comments that his 2019 HP HD is horrendous, making it almost impossible to get such simple tasks done such as browsing and basic homework needs. So far, the reviews seem to tell a different story than the advertised "premium" quality. But, that's not to say there aren't some positive reviews. Eric's sentiment goes with my earlier statement of this laptop being a "budget" product. Once again starting with the recurring argument of lag and delay, he goes on to however say it works decently for basic word applications and streaming sites, and that you do get what you pay for; an opinion we seem to share. 

### Conclusion

From the overall responses I've gathered about this product, many people seem to agree on one almost universal opinion. This laptop is a decent cheap buy for somebody who needs something basic, like a middle school or high school student. But other than that, it has some real issues that need to be addressed by the manufacturers. Especially if some of their shipments are arriving broken or defective to a portion of their customers. Quality over Quantity is a motto that everyone who hopes to be successful in this business should follow.

I rate this a personal 2.5 out of five stars, as it does have some neat features and long battery life. But if you're looking for something fast and productive for long-term projects, or maybe just your everyday job. Then I would consider looking elsewhere.

Thanks for reading!
