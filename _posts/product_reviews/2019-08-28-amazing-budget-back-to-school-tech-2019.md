I’m tired of reading back-to-school tech articles that recommend getting the latest [*MacBook Pro*](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-9th-generation-Intel-Core-i9-processor/dp/B07S58MHXF/ref=sr_1_9?tag=reviewhuntr-20) for $2000 and the [Sony WH1000XM3 Headphones](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/dp/B07G4MNFS1/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2XUJ9MI8F05HM&tag=reviewhuntr-20) for $300. Like, no student has that amount of money! Yes, students need laptops now-a-days and headphones with active noise cancellation is a god send but unless you’ve got rich parents or work part time your entire free time dishing out $2300 on two pieces of tech is unreasonable. Therefore, I’ve put together a list of back-to-school tech for students that won’t break the bank. All the products on this list I either personally own or have tested.

### Acer Aspire 5 Slim Laptop

In most schools having a laptop is essential and unless the school provides you with one you need to get one on your own. So, which one should you get? Well, let’s first go over some basic criteria. The laptop needs to be portable since you’ll be lugging it to and from school every day. There’s no need for it to be a powerhouse since you’ll mostly use office style programs like Word and Excel, but some schools do require more powerful software like SketchUp or Photoshop. Fortunately, all of these programs are well optimized and will work fine on just about any budget laptop. Now when we’ve got that out of the way let’s get to my recommendation.

The [***Acer Aspire 5 Slim Laptop***](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RF1XD36/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=reviewhuntr-20) is a fantastic option. It’ll be able to run practically any software you’ll need for school. My classmate back in high school used this laptop in our final year and he did some pretty heavy CAD on it. So, it’s portable and powerful enough for all your school needs and it is dirt cheap coming in at only $319.99.

What about gaming? It doesn’t have what it takes. You’ll probably be fine playing lightweight casual games on it but don’t expect to be able to run AAA titles. But that’s not a bad thing! For starters there’s no way you’ll be distracted by video games, but a gaming laptop isn’t necessarily a good school laptop. To get a halfway decent gaming laptop you’ll need to dish out at least $700 and at that price point the laptop you’ll get will be far from portable. Gaming laptops are heavier and larger than most other laptops. If you want to play video games, I recommend building a cheap gaming PC instead.

### Plantronics Backbeat Pro 2

Having a pair of headphones with active noise cancellation is pretty much essential for students at this point. Having the ability to face out all your surrounding will make studying so much easier, especially if your class is on the noisy side. The [***Plantronics Backbeat Pro 2***](https://www.amazon.com/Plantronics-Wireless-Noise-Cancelling-Backbeat/dp/B01MY4P9EZ?ref_=bl_dp_s_web_2530165011&tag=reviewhuntr-20) gives you both wired and wireless connectivity as well as *active noise cancellation* for only $131.90. On top of this the headphones let you connect to two devices at the same time and easily switch between them. They also come with smart sensor technology that pauses your music when you take them off and resumes playing when you put them back on, although I’ve personally found this feature to be a bit buggy. All in all, it’s a fantastic pair of headphones for the prices.

### Xiaomi MiBand 3 

Yup, that’s right. I’m recommending the [***Xiaomi MiBand 3***](https://www.amazon.com/Activity-Waterproof-Bracelet-Wristband-Pedometer/dp/B07GNGJK97/ref=sr_1_4?tag=reviewhuntr-20) over the more recent [***MiBand 4***](https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Bracelet-Smartband-Bluetooth-Waterproof/dp/B07T4ZH692/ref=pd_bxgy_200_img_3/147-5361180-6968124?tag=reviewhuntr-20). Why? Well, because it’s half as cheap and still works great. Perhaps this isn’t for everyone but if you’re at all into fitness chances are you’ve looked into getting a fitness tracker and, IMO, the [***Xiaomi MiBand 3***](https://www.amazon.com/Activity-Waterproof-Bracelet-Wristband-Pedometer/dp/B07GNGJK97/ref=sr_1_4?tag=reviewhuntr-20) is the best one you can get. Yeah, there are better ones out there that are double the price but what makes those devices better are only minor things like a full color display. For only $28.98 you’ll get all the essentials you need in a fitness tracker and then some with [***Xiaomi MiBand 3***](https://www.amazon.com/Activity-Waterproof-Bracelet-Wristband-Pedometer/dp/B07GNGJK97/ref=sr_1_4?tag=reviewhuntr-20). It has the expected fitness tracking like steps and workout, heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, etc. It’s also waterproof up to 50 meters so you can safely swim with it. But, thanks to the OLED display on the device it can also tell you the time, receive notifications, be used as a timer, and more! That’s a steal for only $28.98. My only real complaint with the product is that the screen can be a little difficult to see in direct, harsh sunlight. Your health is super important as a student and regular exercise is crucial to optimize how well you study and learn. 

### Anker PowerCore 1000 Power Bank

A power bank is one of those devices that you don’t realize you need until you need one. Most of us can comfortably go through our day without worrying about our phone running out of battery but once you’ve run out of battery and been stranded in the middle of a neighborhood you don’t know you’ll never leave your house without a power bank again. Or, and this might be more likely, your classmate will be running low on battery and needs a way to charge so you’ll get to feel good about helping a classmate in need and you also gain some valuable social points. 

My power bank of choice is the [***Anker PowerCore 1000***]( https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerCore-Ultra-Compact-High-Speed-Technology/dp/B0194WDVHI?ref_=ast_sto_dp&tag=reviewhuntr-20). It’s super portable and has way more power than I’d expect at that size with a whopping 10000mAh battery. For only $24.49 it’s a must buy.

### Samsung Galaxy A70

Finally then, we have to phone. We all need one, it’s the unfortunate truth. Especially as students since the primary way you’ll be in contact with your classmates and friends will be on social media or via text message. Often people will just buy the latest flagship phones because they’d rather pay a couple hundred dollars extra to get a phone from a company that they trust than to get a cheap phone from a Chinese company they don’t know anything about. That’s fine. But unless you absolutely desperately need an iPhone for god knows what reason there’s no need to pay several hundred dollars for the latest flagship if you want a big-name phone. Samsung has a budget line-up of phones called the Galaxy A-series.

My brother uses the [***Samsung Galaxy A70***](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Samsung-Dual-SIM-6-7-Inch-Android-Smartphone-Black/dp/B07QP9R469/ref=sr_1_1?tag=reviewhuntr-20) and I’m genuinely shocked at how good it is. For only **$369** you’ll get a phone with an incredible display, three fantastic cameras, a fingerprint scanner underneath the display, and a super powerful 4500mAh battery. Best of all, it has a headphone jack. There’s an insane amount of value in this phone and I’m shocked at how low it’s priced.

That’s my list of budget back-to-school tech. Just for fun I decided to add everything in my list together and see how much you’d pay if you bought everything on here. In total, for a good school laptop, great headphones with Bluetooth and active noise cancellation, a fitness tracker that has everything you need, a 10000mAh power bank, and an insane Samsung smart phone, you’d pay $874.49 + shipping. That’s way less than the $2300 the *two* products I gave as an example at the start of this article would cost. No need to spend a fortune on tech when you’re on a budget.
