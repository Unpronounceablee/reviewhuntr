School is right around the corner. A lot of students have already started classes or are about to start in a week or two. Personally, I’ll be starting next week. Now, getting a good start to your semester is essential and one part of being as prepared as possible is having the right supplies. What you’ll need can vary a lot depending on what program you’re in, if you’re in primary school, high school, or college but there are a few things that will be absolutely *essential* for school no matter what. Here are the five things every student should have prepared before they go back to school.

### Number 1: Pilot FriXion Pens & Highlighters

The [***Pilot FriXion line of Erasable Pens***](https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/AC823B75-4AFB-4E00-86FF-D4C3C00CFC41?ingress=2&visitId=73704872-0435-46be-94e5-30154e4de3eb&ref_=bl_dp_s_web_7481337011&tag=reviewhuntr-20) are my absolute favorite. I’ve been using them for years and they’re an absolute joy to write with. I’ve always preferred to write with ink pens but always opted for standard mechanical pencils since I want the ability to erase my mistakes. Pilot gives me all the advantages of an ink pen with the ability to erase. What more can I ask for? You can pick up a pack of three [***Pilot FriXion Clicker Pens***](https://www.amazon.com/Pilot-Retractable-Erasable-Mistakes-Disappear/dp/B009QYH52C?ref_=ast_sto_dp&tag=reviewhuntr-20) for only $8.73 over at Amazon.

But there’s one more essential pen students need and that is the highlighter. I didn’t know this until earlier this year but Pilot has a line of [***FriXion Highlighters***](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002B55YCQ/ref=twister_B019ODXAWI?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&tag=reviewhuntr-20), since they’re part of the FriXion line of tools they’re, of course, erasable. Imagine that! If you’re anything like me highlighting your books is painful because you want your book squeaky clean and with the [***Pilot FriXion Light***](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002B55YCQ/ref=twister_B019ODXAWI?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&tag=reviewhuntr-20) you can simply highlight when you read, and when you’re done studying you simply erase the highlight. Does it sound too good to be true? Well, it kind off is. I’ve tried the pen out and while I highly recommend getting this over any other highlighter the erasing doesn’t work 100% of the time. I’ve noticed in some book, mostly older novels or books with rougher pages, that the highlight is hard to erase. In some cases, I even smudged the ink in the book. However, with all course literature I’ve tried the erasing has worked flawlessly. My theory is that the erasing stops working once a page gets too rough. Most normal novels are printed on rather rough paper and the erasing, therefore, doesn’t work as well while most of (if not all) course literature is printed on smoother paper which makes sure the erasing works flawlessly. You can get a pack of three [***Pilot FriXion Highlighters***](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002B55YCQ/ref=twister_B019ODXAWI?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&tag=reviewhuntr-20) for only $5.29 over at Amazon.
Finally, I also recommend picking up the [***Pilot FriXion Eraser***](https://www.amazon.com/Pilot-Frixion-Eraser-Pack-White/dp/B078YKWKM7/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=Frixion+Eraser&qid=1566982562&s=gateway&sr=8-3&tag=reviewhuntr-20). All FriXion products come with a built-in eraser that works phenomenally, I’ve been using the built-in one for years without issue. However, I recently started using the [***Pilot FriXion Eraser***](https://www.amazon.com/Pilot-Frixion-Eraser-Pack-White/dp/B078YKWKM7/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=Frixion+Eraser&qid=1566982562&s=gateway&sr=8-3&tag=reviewhuntr-20) and it’s just so much more effective. The only real differences are that it’s wider and firmer than the built-in erasers, but those simple changes improve the efficiency tenfold. A pack of three costs $4.90 and will last you several years. If you’re on a super tight budget then this item is the one you should skip, but if you have an extra $5 to spend, I highly recommend picking this item up.

### Number 2: A High-Quality Notebook

I used to hate writing in notebooks and that was one of the main reasons I avoided doing a lot of my homework as a kid. One of the reasons I hated writing in notebooks that much is because I just had really low-quality ones. You know the ones you can find in any general store for $2.50 with 200+ pages? Yeah, those ones. It’s hard not to buy them because they seemingly offer an incredible amount of value for the money you spend. But, most of us (especially kids I’ve noticed) can really feel the difference between a low-quality notebook from Target vs. a high-quality notebook from a book- or office supply store. The pages are thinner and feel like they’ll break if you sneeze on them, the lines are either too thick or too thin, and the general layout is just lines across the page. Seriously, if you haven’t tried using a high-quality notebook you’re missing out.

The problem, though, is the fact that a lot of high-quality notebooks are insanely expensive. We’re talking $20+, especially if you don’t buy them online. But a high-quality notebook doesn’t need to break the bank. [***This notebook by Oxford Office***](https://www.amazon.com/Oxford-Office-Smart-Wirebound-Notebook/dp/B005HBQYFC/ref=sr_1_4?qid=1566983623&s=gateway&sr=8-4&srs=10854308011&tag=reviewhuntr-20) is by far my personal favorite notebook and it only costs $5.13 on Amazon. It comes with 180 pages and they’re all high-quality. They feel good to write on, they’re thick, and the layout is great for school since every page come with a “title box” and “date box”. I’ve been using it for years and I can promise you that you won’t be disappointed. 

### Number 3: Sticky Flags

[***Sticky slags***](https://www.amazon.com/Post-Assorted-5-Inch-Dispensers-683XL1/dp/B00QL1AW00/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=Sticky+Flags&qid=1566983005&s=gateway&sr=8-3&tag=reviewhuntr-20) are essential for better organization and studying. You can easily separate and locate areas of your notebook by course and you can easily mark and locate important pages in your course literature. You know what they are. It doesn’t really matter which sticky flags you get, they’re pretty much all the same, but I personally always buy [this pack from Post-it]( https://www.amazon.com/Post-Assorted-5-Inch-Dispensers-683XL1/dp/B00QL1AW00/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=Sticky+Flags&qid=1566983005&s=gateway&sr=8-3&tag=reviewhuntr-20). *Post-it* is a known brand so I trust that their quality is good, and I really like the selection of flags you get in this package. You also get 320 flags so unless you mark absolutely everything you own you probably won’t run out of them any time soon. I’ve personally only had to buy new sticky flags once and I’ve used them for 4 years.

### Number 4: A Portable File Folder

In school you’ll inevitably be handed a ton of hand-outs. Most students just throw them into their bag. Once they pull them back out, they’ll be all crumbled up and destroyed. That’s why you need a portable file folder. Just something to store all your hand-outs in while they’re in your bag.
Again, I’m going to recommend a product from Oxford (they really make the best office supplies). The [Oxford Monogram Executive Twin Pocket Folder]( https://www.amazon.com/Oxford-Monogram-Executive-Folders-04161EE/dp/B001E6B91I?ref_=ast_bbp_dp&tag=reviewhuntr-20) is, in my opinion, the best option. It’s sturdy, it’s stylish, it has a pocket where you can put your contact information in case you lose it, and it’s thin, so it won’t take up too much space in your backpack.

Besides the obvious benefits of a portable file folder it’s also a great way to make a good impression on your teacher. It shows that you’re prepared and take school seriously. Making a good impression on your teacher is super important because, while it shouldn’t be this way, if a teacher has a good impression of you, they’ll be more lenient when grading you. 

### Number 5: A Good Backpack

Of course, you’re going to need some way of carrying all these things. This might be obvious but every year, without fail, someone in my class has forgot to get a backpack so they either use their gym bag or have to carry everything by hand. 

My personal recommendation has to be [***XD Design Bobby Anti-Theft Backpack***](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Original-Anti-Theft-Laptop-Backpack/dp/B01IBGAWWA/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=Bobby+backpack&qid=1566984988&s=gateway&sr=8-5&tag=reviewhuntr-20). It’s the one I personally use, and it’s been great. The main selling point of this backpack is the anti-theft design. The zipper is on the back of the bag so when wearing it it’ll be securely against your back. If someone tries to pick-pocket your bag they first have to touch your back and that’s a risk no thief is willing to take. The biggest benefit of this backpack for me has been the compartments, I can perfectly fit everything I carry into the bag. When I say perfectly, I mean *perfectly*. It’s like a Tetris puzzle. The pieces just fit.

Beside the anti-theft design and useful compartments the [***XD Design Bobby Anti-Theft Backpack***](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Original-Anti-Theft-Laptop-Backpack/dp/B01IBGAWWA/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=Bobby+backpack&qid=1566984988&s=gateway&sr=8-5&tag=reviewhuntr-20) is easier to carry. I have no idea how the do it, they say it’s done using different pressure points and counterweights and stuff. No matter how they do it the fact of the matter is that the backpack is easier to carry than any other backpack. It’s just… light? I’ve compared my [*Bobby Backpack*](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Original-Anti-Theft-Laptop-Backpack/dp/B01IBGAWWA/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=Bobby+backpack&qid=1566984988&s=gateway&sr=8-5&tag=reviewhuntr-20) with my brothers normal backpack, using the *same* contents, the [*Bobby*](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Original-Anti-Theft-Laptop-Backpack/dp/B01IBGAWWA/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=Bobby+backpack&qid=1566984988&s=gateway&sr=8-5&tag=reviewhuntr-20) is somehow lighter. Blows my mind.

That’s the five (technically seven) things I recommend every student pick up before school starts, or at least as soon as possible after school starts. If you’re interested in getting some back-to-school tech that won’t break the bank as well you can find my article on that [here](https://reviewhuntr.com/reviews/amazing-budget-back-to-school-tech-2019/).
